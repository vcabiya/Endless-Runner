# Endless-Runner
## The culmination of my high-school java coding journey!
While this is probably not the best project I'll ever write in Java, I think it's still pretty impressive for what it is. A 2D 
endless runner game with mechanics to increase your score if you come close to an obstacle. About 3 months of hard work for me at 17 years old,
this is a treasured project.
